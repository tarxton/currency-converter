(e.g., $ for USD, â‚¬ for EUR)

## Ability to quit in the middle of the conversion

The application is made in a way so that the user can freely stop the conversion process whenever he wants, so he can adjust the currencies or the amount however he wants, even if he made a mistake. 

## Enable reverse converting

It provides a reverse conversion option to switch between the "from" and "to" currencies without re-entering values so the user is able to continue with conversion quicker and easier if he wants to continue and convert another amount of money.
